# Read me

The original idea is from  
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78581753/problem-with-httpsession-serialization-classnotfoundexception-after-migration

From that question I have decided the create this project.

This project creates a Hazelcast client to connect to an existing Hazelcast cluster

1. On the cluster user code deployment feature must be active
2. The client needs to deploy some Spring classes to cluster for spring session to work
